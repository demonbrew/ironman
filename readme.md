# Iron Man Reactor

The normal process for me to get inspired for Halloween is to browse various DIY build websites sometime around June or July each year. I typically try to find projects where I can re-use parts I already have. One year, I decided to to do a low budget Tony Stark Iron Man. Low budget as in - not build or buy an actual Iron Man armor suit.

Inspiration and instructions came from [Adafruit Superhero Power Plant](https://learn.adafruit.com/superhero-power-plant?embeds=allow)

## Parts list
- GEMMA v2 or GEMMA M0 wearable microcontroller
- NeoPixel ring
- single FLORA NeoPixel
- solid-core hookup wire
- JST extension cable
- 3xAAA battery pack with batteries
- 2x laser-cut/etched acrylic in clear or white [files on Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:157296)
- [Circuit Python code](https://github.com/demonbrew/ironman/reactor.py)

This was before I had a 3D printer, so I found an online service that would print the design rather cheaply. The printout came out very clean, all I had to do was hand paint it and then assemble.

Soldering was very straightforward with the Adafruit instructions. For the costume, I bought a thin sport type shirt - similar to how Tony looks when he's in the build shop. I even grew the rather intricate goatee as well. It turned out great, was a fun project to work on, and I got plenty of compliments on Halloween night.
